# About Novelty

Here, we'll define novelty as "situations that violate implicit or explicit
assumptions about agents, the environment, or their interactions."

We'll group novelty into multiple levels and three categories: entities and
attributes, interactive, and external.

### Entities and Attributes
#### Level 0: Instances
"Previously unseen objects or entities."

Ideas:
  - Putting things in positions most likely to inspire learning
  - Example: spawning in a mountain near the player
  
#### Level 1: Class
"Previously unseen classes of objects or entities."

Ideas:
  - Putting types of things that haven't been witnessed before
  - Example: spawning in a new type of meat

#### Level 2: Attribute
Change in a feature or an object or entity, such as color, shape, or
orientation, not previously relevant to classification or action."

Ideas:
  - Putting types of things that haven't been witnessed before
  - Example: Making creepers blue instead of green or upside down

### Level 3: Representations
Change in how entities and features are specified, corresponding to a
transformation of dimensions or coordinate system, not necessarily spatial
or temporal.

Ideas:
  - ???
  - Example: Not entirely sure


### Interactive
#### Level 4: Relations (static)
"Change in allowed relationshpis between entities such as in object-class
hierarchies, or adjacency (if in physical space)."

Ideas:
 - Not entirely sure.

#### Level 5: Interactions (dynamic)
"Change in allowed interactions between entities, i.e., 'rules of the games'
resulting in state changes"

Ideas:
  - Example: Now a furnace will explode when done smelting
  - Another example: Villagers will now try to kill you if you interact with them

#### Level 6: Capabilities
"Change in objectives of actions, especially in a multi-entity or adversarial
environment."

Ideas:
  - Giving new capabilities to existing already-seen items
  - Example: A bow and arrow will now


### External
#### Level 7: Environment
"Change in the world independent affecting all entities similarly, depending on
factors independent of entity."

Ideas:
  - Changing attributes of the whole world, not just entities within
  - Example: Now it's always night

#### Level 8: Goals
"Change in objectives of actions, especially in an multi-entity or adverarial
environment."

Ideas:
  - Changing the objectives of the experiment
  - Example: instead of trying to cross a ravine by yourself, you now have to race others.

#### Level 9: Context
"Change in meaning of actions that provides a different interpretation or
narrative frame on a series of interactions."

Ideas:
  - "Change in meaning of actions that provides a different interpretation or narrative frame on a series of interactions"
  - Example: I don't even know.
